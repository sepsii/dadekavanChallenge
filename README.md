# Knauf Coding challenge

Write a nextjs application in typescript with the follow requirements:

- List of blog post (visualize title and author email, it's important to show the email and not the name)
- Detail of a blog post, so show title, body, information about the author (name, username,email and website) and the list of associated comment.

⚠️ **Please send us the repository link so that we can check it**

## Area of focus

Please focus to create a clean and structured typescript code.
Use the best practice to create components and share states.

## What we will look at

- We want to see how you write and manage code (name structure of the folders, usage of interfaces, naming conventions)
- How you write components, the correct usage of hooks and to have an eye on performance
- How you set up the state, if you use a library like redux or the context api and be ready to motivate it
- BONUS: unit tests

## Timing

Considering the brevity of the application we expect this to be done by noon the next day (limit 12.00)
